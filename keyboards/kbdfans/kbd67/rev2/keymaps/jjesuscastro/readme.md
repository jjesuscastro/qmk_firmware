<p>* Custom Keycode

## Caps Lock
<p>Enabling caps lock will make the rbg underflow blink on a fixed interval. Pressing 'CAPS Speed -' or 'CAPS Speed +', FN + A or FN + S respectively, will change the interval between blinks.
<p>The RGB Effect that will blink is not a static color. rgblight_toggle() will be called repeatedly hence keeping the currently used RGB Effect.
