## Caps Lock
<p>Caps Lock ON and OFF have separate RGB underglow effects.
<p>To set the RGB underglow effect that will indicate if Caps Lock is ON, just simply turn on Caps Lock and change your RGB underglow as normal. Turning off your Caps Lock after changing should revert your RGB underglow to what it was before prior to turning on Caps Lock.
